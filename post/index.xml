I&amp;rsquo;m Bernat and I am a software developer born in Barcelona who moved to London in 2012 when my life was in desperate need of a radical change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a variety of reasons, me and my family decided that April 2020 was the right time to relocate again, this time to the Czech Republic. We had it all planned: we would go to Prague, do some flat viewings, give notice to our landlord to leave the current flat, then go back to London to wrap things up there, and finally leave the UK at the end of April to start a new life in Prague.&lt;/p>
