I&rsquo;m Bernat and I am a software developer born in Barcelona who moved to London in 2012 when my life was in desperate need of a radical change.</p><p>For a variety of reasons, me and my family decided that April 2020 was the right time to relocate again, this time to the Czech Republic. We had it all planned: we would go to Prague, do some flat viewings, give notice to our landlord to leave the current flat, then go back to London to wrap things up there, and finally leave the UK at the end of April to start a new life in Prague.</p><p>And then The Apocalypse started&mldr;</p><p>The situation we were in was not great: we had given notice on our flat and other tenants were lined up already, which meant changing plans and trying to stay in the UK was going to be very difficult:</p><ul><li>We didn&rsquo;t know if we would be able to find a new flat before the end of tenancy date.</li><li>We didn&rsquo;t even know if a relocation within the UK would be possible given how quickly the crisis was escalating. It was clear the UK was headed to a full lockdown that could last for months, and we didn&rsquo;t want to get stuck in the country for longer than we needed to.</li><li>Having to relocate within the UK without knowing how long for, and only to have to relocate again to the Czech Republic was not ideal, especially given we have 2 little kids. Short lease options were there but not great from a financial point of view.</li><li>Things were getting quite nasty at our local supermarkets and chemists: it was really difficult to find the most basic food, including formula for our little one. This made us panic a little bit.</li></ul><p>So we set plans in motion to move countries within days. This obviously presented some challenges.</p><p>The first one was finding a way for our belongings to be relocated. In normal circumstances we would have looked at differnent services and quotes, we would have packed carefully what we wanted to move with and we would eventually have had our stuff either shipped in boxes or picked up by a company to be driven to Prague. However we were faced with a very short notice and also with news that most European countries were closing their borders to non essential crossings. This meant that all companies we contacted were unsure if they would be able to do the job or how long it&rsquo;d take them to actually get the goods there. We were incredibly lucky to find a Slovak company that regularly travels from London to Slovakia, and was willing to come to our flat on a very short notice to pick up all our stuff and drive it there in a coupe of days. Packing all our belongings in three days while at the same time having to take care of 2 little kids, and also having to work remotely from home in one of the busiest trading weeks of the year was a lot of fun. And the end result was that we couldn&rsquo;t really pack all we needed, so we had to leave some of our belongings behind.</p><p>The second challenge was actually finding a bloody flight ticket to get us from London to Prague. This was hell. First we thought of keeping our original flight tickets for the 31 of March as a backup plan, and try to find another flight ticket earlier. EasyJet was not selling tickets anymore. Ryanair was. We booked a flight earlier in the week for Friday. A couple of days later the flight was cancelled. We looked into other days and managed to book another one for Monday. This one was cancelled a few hours later. In a moment of panic we booked yet another one for Wednesday. It was cancelled an hour later. We then looked into moving the original British Airways ticket to an earlier date. Found a flight for Friday. We decided to pay the price difference and give it a chance.</p><p>The third challenge was to make sure British Airways would let us board the flight. My partner and kids are Czech citizens, but I am not. And at the time only Czech nationals were allowed into the country by air. We obviously didn&rsquo;t want to have to split the family. In the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic there was an exception list that said that parents of Czech minors should be allowed in, so we hoped this would be enough. We had to go to the Czech Embassy in London to get emergency Czech Passports for the kids, which wasn&rsquo;t fun given we were still in the middle of packing.</p><p>And then we tried to do the online check-in: British Airways automated check-in process failed and told us our travelling documents were not good to get on the plane. That moment was devastating. I was convinced the moment we tried to check-in at the airport they would not let me board because I did not have a Czech Passport. Usually these days when decisions are made by software systems, especially in big companies like airlines, there&rsquo;s very little margin for negotiation or trying to reason. All we could do is go there with a printed version of the travel ban exceptions list and hope for the best. And then a few hours later I got an email: &ldquo;Your flight has been cancelled&rdquo;. I almost fainted. I kept reading the email and it said we had been automatically rebooked for a later flight on that same Friday. Looks like BA had 3 flights to Prague on that day and they decided to consolidate them all into one. There was still hope.</p><p>On Thursday evening a lorry drove to us and all the belongings we could pack were loaded into it. The driver drove away. We could end up on a situation whereby all our stuff would made it to Czech but we would not. Because we had to also contemplate the option of all or one of us going back to the flat on Friday, we had to leave some stuff behind as well: food, bedding, kitchen stuff, etc. That evening we also had to make a very difficult decision, probably one of the most difficult ones of my life: &ldquo;what will we do if they won&rsquo;t let me fly?". The decision was that we would split the family: let my partner and my kids go to Czech and I would either stay behind in London or try to make my way to Barcelona, and we would regroup when possible.</p><p>Needless to say, I didn&rsquo;t sleep that night.</p><p>And then Friday came. A funny side note: I double booked a cab, just in case. Of course I forgot to cancel one of the bookings when the first cab came, so during one of the worst weeks of my life I also had to endure an angry Black Cab driver insulting me and yelling at me in front of my kids, but that&rsquo;s a story for another day. We arrived at the airport, we went to the British Airways desks. The woman looked at our documents and our destinations and asked me the dreaded question: &ldquo;Do you have a Czech Passport or a Czech Residence Card?". I didn&rsquo;t. After we showed her the exceptions list and a few phone calls, she said it&rsquo;d be ok, and made some notes on the computer to ensure there would not be any further issues at the boarding gate. First obstacle gone. Would they let me board at the gate? I didn&rsquo;t know. Would they let me into Czech in Prague airport? I didn&rsquo;t know either.</p><p>And so we went through security, and we waited. I was trying to spend as much time as possible with the kids because that may have been the last time I had them with me for a very long while. When it was time for the gate information to be shown in the panels, instead of a gate number, the words &ldquo;delayed&rdquo; appeared on the screen. My heart was racing. That&rsquo;s the last thing I needed. After 15 horrible minutes we had a gate number. We started to walk. The we got into the boarding gate counter. The guy there saw my Spanish Passport and took us to a side. Shit. Not again. A woman came and asked us the same question: no Czech Passport? No Residency Permit? We explained the same thing again, but they would not take it this time. They asked if we had a marriage certificate. We are not married. After a good while, they checked their computer and saw the notes from the check-in woman who issued our boarding passes. Apparently that convinced them, and they let us in. Second hurdle behind us.</p><p>Once in the plane, the 2 hours went slowly. We landed. When we left the aircraft, there was a crew of people waiting with lots of cleaning products ready to fully disinfect the aircraft. It felt really really odd and a testament of the weird times we&rsquo;re living. Then we prepared all the paperwork to cross the border control. The guy at the counter did not even ask any questions. We went it.</p><p>And then we cried. We cried a lot. It was over.</p><p>This was easily one of the worst weeks of my life. Having to say good bye to 8 years of our lives in London like this was horrible. We could not say good bye to our friends. We could not say good bye to our colleagues. We could not say good bye to Chiswick, Richmond, Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush and all the other places in London that have been so important to us over time. We could not properly say good bye to our flat, and to the back garden we spent so many hours tending to. We didn&rsquo;t have time to explain to our older kid what was going on. And we also had to leave some stuff behind us that we wished we could have taken with us.</p><p>But the good news is that we made it. And of all possible outcomes, the one we ended up with was the best one. We managed to leave, together, and we are finally starting our new life in the Czech Republic. As I write this I am comfortably sitting on a garden chair, drinking Kozel Černý while my older kid is playing with her cousin on a slide. I still have a job and I can work remotely.</p><p>And this has also reminded me of the wonderful people that surround me, so I would like to say a very big thank you to all of you out there that have been supporting and helping me through difficult times.</p><p>I have been thinking for a while now if I should start writing a blog where I can share my experiences of relocating to a foreign country, mostly to keep myself entertained with the very little free time I have, and this is definitely not what I imagined my first post would be like, but I think it was worth sharing, even if it&rsquo;s to remind myself of the gory details of a week I will most likely never forget.</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=next><a href=/post/about-names/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="About names">Next
