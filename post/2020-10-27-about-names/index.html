<p>I have a name. No surprises there. My partner also has a name. No surprises there either. What is surprising is the amount of trouble our names have given us on our adventures in the three countries we have lived our lives: Spain, England and the Czech Republic. I had an incident recently that made me think of this again and I though it would be interesting to write about it a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I have not used real names here but made up ones that would be typical of Catalan and Czech people.</p>
<p>If you come from a Catalan family, your full name might be something like <em>Bernat Ferrer i Coromines</em>. There the tradition is to have a given name, in this case <em>Bernat</em>, and then 2 surnames: one for each of your parents. So for the name above, you&rsquo;d expect <em>Ferrer</em> to be the surname of the father, and <em>Coromines</em> the one from the mother (you can change the order now if you want to, and of course the current laws are more complex to acommodate for circumstances like single parents). To make things even more interesting, some families choose to add an <em>i</em> between the surnames, which means <em>and</em> in Catalan, as a way to link both surnames. This is the case at hand, hence why, the full name is <em>Bernat Ferrer i Coromines</em>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the Czech Republic now. A typical name for a woman there could be <em>Jana Nováčková</em>. Her surname is <em>Nováčková</em>, it&rsquo;s the family surname, and she only has one, like in Britain, where only one of the surnames is passed to the children. Jana&rsquo;s father, however, won&rsquo;t have the surname <em>Nováčková</em>, it&rsquo;ll be <em>Nováček</em>. It turns out family names in Czech have a gender. So the family name is <em>Nováček</em>, masculine, but if you are a woman, you change it to <em>Nováčková</em>. Same as in Britain, in the Czech Republic it&rsquo;s also a tradition (but not an obligation) to change your surname to your husband&rsquo;s if you are a woman and get married. In Spain that&rsquo;s not the case, and women keep their surnames after marriage.</p>
<p>Let me now tell you what happens when you relocate from Spain to Britain and you need to deal with all the paperwork where your name is required.</p>
<p>First of all, in Britain they only have 1 surname. So when you need to fill in your name in any form, you can expect only 2 fields: forename and surname (and maybe middle names). What you end up doing is basically cramming your 2 surnames into the single surname field. It&rsquo;s not an ideal situation because some information gets lost, but it is what it is. In our example, we would fill in <em>Bernat</em> as our forename and <em>Ferrer i Coromines</em> as our surname.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not the end of the story. When some IT systems and some humans see something like <em>Ferrer i Coromines</em> as a surname in the UK, they don&rsquo;t cope well. This is widespread and creates lots of friction for people like me. Nothing critical, but after the years it ends up wearing one out. A couple of examples of problematic situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some websites or other IT systems won&rsquo;t take &ldquo;special characters&rdquo; in a surname, and apparently a space is a special character for a surname. So you are applying for a bank account, or a credit card, or something like this, and you cannot self serve because the system considers that your surname is not valid. In a society with such cultural richness and diversity you would expect they would have ditched rules about what a &ldquo;valid surname&rdquo; is but, alas, they have not.</li>
<li>You would not believe the amount of people or systems that try to be smart and &ldquo;parse and classify&rdquo; your surname to make it fit into their predefined model. I guess it&rsquo;s human nature, and computers are programmed by humans after all. When they see <em>Bernat Ferrrer Coromines</em> (note that I omitted the <em>i</em> in this example) they immediately think <em>Bernat</em> is the name, <em>Ferrer</em> is the middle name and <em>Coromines</em> is the surname. When they see the <em>i</em> their heads just explode. I lived in London for 8 years and in my local pharmacy and GP practices I was always filed under the letter <em>M</em> for my second surname rather than the <em>R</em> for my first surname, because they thought my first surname was my middle name.</li>
<li>Needless to say, I also had to drop the one diacritic my name has.</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples above may not look like a big deal, but it was a constant reminder that you simply did not fit in, that you were different, and that things here and there were not designed for people like you.</p>
<p>During my 8 years in London I was never victim of racism. After all I am a white, middle aged man. However when I was first trying to open a bank account at the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush Barclays local branch, I will never forget how the clerk who served me turned me away making remarks about my name &ldquo;being suspicious&rdquo; (even though I was holding an official Spanish password) and how he told me to go to a Santander branch as &ldquo;they will be able to help you and understand you there&rdquo;. If this were to happen to me now I would have put my foot down, but I was new in the UK back then so I went elsewhere.</p>
<p>After we relocated to the Czech Republic, the same thing happened again.</p>
<p>Another funny story is how my name took down the IT systems of a local bank branch in Prague for a day. My real surname has a diacritic, <em>à</em>. Most people simply type <em>a</em> on their computers to avoid problems, but the bank clerk decided to type it in properly when opening a bank account for me. Apparently this messed up with their system and they had to get an <em>IT guy</em> to get it sorted the day after.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about children. A Catalan man and a Czech woman walk into a pub in West London, they fall in love and have 2 kids&mldr;</p>
<p>The kids are British&mldr; and Spanish and Czech. And their births need to be registered in the three countries.</p>
<p>Britain is quite pragmatic when it comes to naming your kids. As long as what you chose is clearly not offensive, you can pretty much name them whatever you want, name, middle name and surname. To go with what was the norm there, we decided to give our kids just one surname, mine.</p>
<p>However things were not that simple in the Czech Republic. The law in Czechia says the kids should have the same surname as their father. But yet again, I have 2 surnames, which is something some of the civil servants at the registry didn&rsquo;t quite get. Not only that, since one of the kids is a female, the surname also needs to be in feminine, and making a non Czech surname feminine apparently sounds really odd. Also, which one of my 2 surnames should be made feminine? Probably both?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the example names: <em>Bernat Ferrer i Coromines</em> as the father, <em>Jana Nováčková</em> as the mother. At some point we were offered the following options to name our daughter (let&rsquo;s say her name is <em>Adéla</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Adéla Ferrerova</em>.</li>
<li><em>Adéla Ferrer i Coromines Nováčková</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of them was ideal. The first one sounded really odd (so I am told) in Czech as <em>Ferrer</em> is not a Czech surname, and it sounds really odd for me as well, since we do not have gender in surnames. And the second one is ridiculously long and complicated, that would make her life difficult when it comes to bureaucracy for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>After much discussion, we managed to be allowed to give our kids the same names as they have in their British passports.</p>
<p>How about Spain? By law they are required to have 2 surnames, the one from the father and the one from the mother. However in Spain we do not have genders when it comes to family names. We have male and female kids, and we were hesitating if the Spanish authorities would allow us to register them with a feminine surname, but only the Czech one, because otherwise it would sound really weird to have a masculine Czech family name and/or a feminine Catalan family name. Let&rsquo;s now assume the male&rsquo;s name is <em>Adam</em>, we have the following combinations (remember, the father&rsquo;s surname is <em>Ferrer</em> and the mother&rsquo;s name is <em>Nováčková</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Adam Ferrer Nováčková</em>. Technically speaking, and given the father and the mother&rsquo;s passports, that&rsquo;s what the Spanish law says the kid should be named. But it&rsquo;s really odd for the mother, since a male is named with a feminine surname.</li>
<li><em>Adam Ferrer Nováček</em>. This was our ideal situation.</li>
<li><em>Adela Ferrerová Nováčková</em>. Here we have added an <em>ová</em> suffix to a Catalan surname to make it female gender. It&rsquo;s really odd to read for a Catalan since we do not do this with surnames.</li>
<li><em>Adela Ferrer Nováčková</em>. This was again our ideal scenario, where she&rsquo;d keep the female version of the mother&rsquo;s surname, but also keep the unmodified neutral surname of the father.</li>
</ul>
<p>To our surprise, we were allowed to adopt the names we wanted. I suspect since this was done at the Spanish Consulate in London where the civil servants must me more used to interesting naming schemes from multiple cultures, this was not an unusual case for them. I wonder if it&rsquo;d been the same if we had done this in Spain.</p>
<p>In conclusion: it&rsquo;s lovely to have a multi cultural family, but it comes with its challenges! Also, for Pete&rsquo;s sake, it&rsquo;s 2020, how about we stop assuming what a valid name is? (also, as a developer, let me give you one last piece of advice: please also stop trying to validate postal addresses, you will ultimately screw it up).</p>
